1. Product Vision
A high-aesthetic digital stationery app where users create "tactile" multimedia letters. The goal is to make digital communication feel as special as receiving physical mail.

2. User Journey & Page Requirements
Page 1: Home Screen
Hero Section: A clean, minimalist header with the name "Lunar Cards."
Main CTA: A large "Start a Letter" button.
Inspiration Gallery: A "Recent Creations" grid showing 3 non-functional preview cards (e.g., "Birthday Vibe," "Love Note," "Thank You").
Ad Slot: A responsive banner at the bottom of the screen.
Page 2: The Studio (Editor)
The Canvas: A 5:7 aspect ratio "Paper" container.
Background Selector: A tray to switch textures (Classic White, Crumpled Paper, Midnight Blue, Rose Petal).
Text Styling: * Add text boxes.
Font options: Handwritten (Cursive), Typewriter (Monospace), Elegant (Serif).
Media Handling:
Drag-and-Drop: Ability to upload images and move them anywhere on the canvas.
Sticker Library: A grid of decorative icons/shapes.
Monetization Prompt: Premium stickers (marked with a star) trigger a $0.99 payment simulation/overlay.
The "Send" Flow: A "Send" button that opens a choice: "Send via Email" or "Get Share Link."
Page 3: The Receiver's Experience
The Unboxing:
User opens a link and sees a closed Envelope with their name.
User clicks the flap.
Animation: The flap opens, and the Letter "slides out" (upward pull) and expands to full screen.
Viral Loop: At the bottom of the letter, a button appears: "That was sweet! Create your own Lunar Card."
Ad Slot: A native ad unit placed below the "Create Your Own" button.
3. Monetization Strategy
Micro-transactions: $0.99 for "Premium" stickers or backgrounds.
Display Ads: * Banner: Home page and Receiver page.
Interstitial: Full-screen ad shown only after the sender clicks "Send" (this is the highest earning ad type).
Pro Tier (Optional): $1.99 to remove all ads for both the sender and the receiver.
4. Technical Specifications for AI
Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations).
State Logic: * The app must save the letter configuration (background, text content, image coordinates, and sticker IDs) as a JSON object.
The "Receiver Link" should be a unique ID that loads this specific JSON object.
Animation Focus:
Envelope Pull-out: Use a Y-axis translation with a slight scale increase.
Drag-and-Drop: Use framer-motion's drag prop for images and stickers.
